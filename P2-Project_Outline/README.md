# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
     During our group discussion, my initial idea was a platform for artists to sell prints and original paintings.
But, after thinking about logistical issues such as multiple people potentially trying to buy an original painting,
or some tattoo shops' websites already selling their artists' work, I have switched my idea.
     Instead, I would like to build a web application that would help humane societies and animal shelters adopt their pets.
Two types of accounts would exist- an account for humane societies and an account for people looking to adopt an animal.
The humane societies will have their own profile, on which they can upload pictures and create brief descriptions
of the dogs they have available for adoption (later on I would like to add the option to list different types of animals).
The dog profiles will have a picture, an age and weight description, and an optional space for the humane society to
briefly describe the dog's personality.
     The other account type, for users, will be able to search by humane society (later on I would like to be able to
search by dog breed, size, or age) and be able to "save" the dogs they like to their profile.
     People will also be able to contact the humane society about listings and availability.

### Features
     -Login and create a profile
	 -Upload pictures
	 -Link with social media
	 -Email the humane society
	 -Google Maps to find the nearest humane societies (if time permits)

### Technologies
     C#
	 ASP.Net Core MVC
	 Bootstrap
	 SQL Server Database

### What I'll Have to Learn
     I will have to learn how to login to an account with social media, open up an email between a user account
and the humane society, and allow Google Maps to locate an address. 
     I would also like to make the application look nice, if time permits, so I will have to learn how to integrate
Bootstrap into my code.
